## ðŸŒŸ Introduction

React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. With its component-based architecture, it has revolutionized how we think about building web applications. This repository aims to consolidate some of the most frequently asked questions in React interviews to help you prepare and excel.

## ðŸŒŸ Questions by Category

### Basics

1. **What is React?**
   - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook.
   
2. **What are the key features of React?**
   - Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs.
   - Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state.
   - Learn Once, Write Anywhere: Develop new features without rewriting existing code.

### Hooks

1. **What are React hooks?**
   - Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.
   
2. **Can you explain the useState hook?**
   - `useState` is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

### State Management

1. **What is Redux?**
   - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, often used with React.

2. **What are the core principles of Redux?**
   - Single source of truth
   - State is read-only
   - Changes are made with pure functions

### Performance Optimization

1. **What is the purpose of React.memo?**
   - `React.memo` is a higher order component that prevents a component from re-rendering if its props have not changed.

2. **How can you optimize React applications?**
   - Use React.memo
   - Use the useMemo and useCallback hooks
   - Code-splitting with React.lazy and Suspense

### Testing

1. **What are some common tools used for testing React applications?**
   - Jest
   - React Testing Library
   - Enzyme

2. **How do you test a React component?**
   - By using Jest and React Testing Library to create and run test cases.

### Best Practices

1. **What are some best practices for writing React components?**
   - Keep components small and focused.
   - Reuse components whenever possible.
   - Write meaningful names and prop types.

2. **How do you manage state in a large application?**
   - Use state management libraries like Redux or MobX.
   - Use Context API for simpler state management.
